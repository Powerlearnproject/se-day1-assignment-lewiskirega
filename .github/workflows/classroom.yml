            options:
              a: "The study of hardware components"
              b: "The process of designing, developing, and maintaining software"
              c: "The analysis of networking protocols"
              d: "The management of data storage systems"
            correct_answer: "b"

          - question: "Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering."
            correct_answer:
              - "The first compiler: The invention of the first compiler in the 1950s marked a significant milestone in the evolution of software engineering."
              - "The development of the first integrated development environment (IDE): The advent of IDEs in the 1980s further revolutionized software engineering."
              - "The rise of agile methodologies: The emergence of agile methodologies in the 1990s represents another significant milestone in software engineering."

          - question: "List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle."
            correct_answer:
              - "Requirements: Gathering and documenting users' needs."
              - "Design: Designing the software architecture."
              - "Implementation: Writing code and building the software."
              - "Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the standards."
              - "Deployment: Releasing the software to the user."
              - "Maintenance: Providing ongoing support such as updates."

          - question: "Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate."
            correct_answer: "Agile methods are iterative approaches focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change, while the Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases."

          - question: "Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team."
            correct_answer:
              Software_Developer: "Responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems."
              Quality_Assurance_Engineer: "Developing and implementing testing protocols to ensure that software systems meet the required standards."
              Project_Manager: "Overseeing the entire software development process, including planning, coordinating, and controlling the project lifecycle."

          - question: "Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each."
            correct_answer:
              IDE: "A tool that helps in writing, testing, debugging, and testing code, e.g., Visual Studio Code."
              VCS: "Important because it tracks changes made to code and helps in coordinating work among team members, e.g., Git."

          - question: "What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges."
            correct_answer:
              - "Tight deadlines: Communicate effectively with stakeholders, manage time effectively, and prioritize tasks."
              - "Changing requirements: Be flexible and adaptable, and have a clear understanding of the project vision and requirements."

          - question: "Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance."
            correct_answer:
              Unit_Testing: "Testing individual units of code to ensure they behave as expected."
              Integration_Testing: "Testing integrated code units to ensure they work together as expected."
              System_Testing: "Testing a complete software system to ensure it meets specified requirements."
              Acceptance_Testing: "Testing a software system to ensure it meets the user's acceptance criteria."

          - question: "Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models."
            correct_answer: "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing natural language prompts to get the desired response from an AI model."

          - question: "Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective."
            correct_answer:
              Vague: "What is the best way to travel?"
              Improved: "What is the fastest way to travel from New York to Los Angeles?"
              Explanation: "The improved prompt is more specific and concise, making it easier for the AI model to understand and provide a relevant response."
